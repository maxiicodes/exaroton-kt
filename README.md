# Exaroton API Client

---

## About

This is an unofficial library for the [exaroton API](https://developers.exaroton.com/), which you can use to manage your
servers.
Since the official library doesn't deliver good type safety, this library was written entirely in Kotlin using Ktor and
took some inspiration from the [kord library](https://github.com/kordlib/kord), but exposes the same classes and methods
as the official library.

It's currently still WIP. Therefore, some help would be really appreciated. ^^
